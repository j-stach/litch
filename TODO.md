[TCP option](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/technicalsupport/specifications/dataproducts/itchcompression.pdf)


## For/with slouch:
- Get together a set of types that they have in common.
- Make a crate that they can both depend on.
- For now, while building parsers here, comment out the slouch types
- [ ] `StockSymbol`
- [ ] timestamp helpers & `NaiveTime` reexport
